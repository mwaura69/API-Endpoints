# Project API Routes and Logic

This project encompasses a series of API routes and their corresponding logic for user authentication, product management, order processing, and cart operations.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of these routes is to handle user interactions with the system, including user account management, login, authentication, order creation, product management, and cart handling.

## Technologies Used

The code provided is built using the following technologies and frameworks:

- `Express.js`: A web application framework for Node.js, utilized to build the API endpoints.
- `Bcrypt`: A library for hashing passwords.
- `MongoDB`: Presumably used as the database for this project.
- `Mongoose`: A MongoDB object modeling tool, possibly used to interact with the database.
- `JWT`: Used for authentication and generating tokens.

## Code Overview

### Route Structure
The routes are organized into various categories:

1. **User Management**
    - `/users/signup`: Route to register a new user.
    - `/users/login`: Route to authenticate and log in a user.
    - `/user/buyer/signup`: Route to create a buyer's account.
    - `/user/buyer/login`: Route to log in a buyer's account.
    - `/users/buyer/priviledges/:id`: Route to grant admin privileges.
    - `/users/shippingdetails/:id`: Route to set user shipping details.

2. **Order Handling**
    - `/orders/create`: Route to create an order.
    - `/orders/update/:orderId`: Route to update order details.
    - `/orders/user/:userId`: Route to retrieve orders by user ID.
    - `/orders/user/:id`: Route to delete order details.

3. **Product Management**
    - `/products/create`: Route to create a product.
    - `/products/list`: Route to retrieve a list of products.
    - `/products/update/:productId`: Route to update product details.
    - `/updateInventory/:productId`: Route to update product inventory.
    - `/products/delete/:id`: Route to delete a product.
    - `/products/get/:userId`: Route to get user-specific products.

4. **Cart Operations**
    - `/carts/put`: Route to add items to the cart.
    - `/carts/list/:userId`: Route to retrieve cart items by user ID.
    - `/carts/delete/:id`: Route to delete items from the cart after checkout.

### Key Features
- **User Authentication**: Sign-up and login routes with password hashing.
- **Admin Privileges**: Route to grant admin privileges to users.
- **Order and Cart Management**: Routes to create, update, and delete orders and handle cart operations.
- **Product Management**: Routes for creating, updating, retrieving, and deleting products.

## Running the Code
- Ensure MongoDB is running and properly configured.
- Install the required dependencies: Express, Bcrypt, Mongoose, etc.
- Start the server and ensure the routes are accessible through appropriate HTTP requests.

## Improvements
- Error handling: Implement more detailed error messages and handle edge cases for a more robust system.
- Input validation: Incorporate input validation to ensure data integrity and prevent potential issues.

Please note that this README is a general overview and does not cover every detail of the code implementation.
